- total 26335 samples, each specie contains at most 400 samples.
- the graph is made up of four atoms, C, H, O and Pt, atoms connected by an edge keeps a distance < 2Å
- the graph in the dataset, e.g. [2, 1.4006454566792093, 3], means the distance of atom 2 and atom 3 is 1.4006454566792093Å
- the energy is calculated by DFT(using VASP)
- graph of CH-O (distance of atoms not applied)
